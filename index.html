         <p>
         I am a lecturer in the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/lr/organisatie/afdelingen/flow-physics-and-technology/aerodynamics" target="_blacnk">Aerodynamics section at TU Delft</a>, where I conduct research at the intersection of numerical methods, physical modeling and high-performance computing to study complex turbulent flow phenomena. My role also involves developing advanced computational tools and delivering hands-on training in advanced scientific computing, including distributed, shared-memory, and GPU programming. I also support TU Delft's HPC community in the use of the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/dhpc/system" target="_blank">DelftBlue</a> supercomputer.

         <h2>reasearch topics I care about</h2>
         <p>
            I have long been interested in the dynamics of shock-induced recirculation bubbles. In recent years, my work has expanded toward the practical application of flow control and the use of deep reinforcement learning to develop effective control strategies. Alongside this, I study compressible wall-bounded turbulence for physics-based modeling, including inflow turbulence generation and non-equilibrium wall models for large-eddy simulations. A list of selected publications highlighting my work is provided <a href="publications.html">here</a>. I also work extensively in massively parallel scientific computing across various architectures, with a strong focus on I/O performance and scalability.

         <em>mens sana in corpore sano.</em> I try to live by it: <a href="exercise.html">exercising</a> daily, eating a clean, plant-based diet, and making space for proper rest. Daily meditation has also been genuinely life-changing, despite having once dismissed it. I also love reading (check out my <a href="reading.html">reading list</a>), having meaningful conversations with friends, and when time allows, playing the guitar and messing around with a DDJ-FLX4. More recenlty, a trip to Guinea-Bissau marked another turning point in my life, something I hope to write about soon.
