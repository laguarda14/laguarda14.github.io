      <p>Exercise is essential, not just for physical health, but also for staying mentally grounded.</p>

      <p>I play tennis weekly and take private lessons to keep improving my game. I'm a heavy topspin player.</p>

      <p>I also play basketball occasionally on the street courts. It's hard to let this sport go after years of competition from childhood through my early twenties.</p>

      <p>Moreover, I spend plenty of time in the gym, focusing on strength training and lifting heavy.</p>

      <p>In fact, the motto is to <em>lift heavy and run fast</em> (I run regularly as well): my PB on 10 km is at 4'05"/km, and on the half marathon is at 4'28"/km. I'm now training for a marathon (March 2026).</p>
